                <h2>In comics: Created by writer Joe Simon and artist Jack Kirby for Timely (later Marvel) Comics, Captain America debuted in March 1941 in Captain America Comics no. 1.</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Creation: Captain America was first conceived as a comic book character in 1940, as a direct response to the military actions of Nazi Germany, prior to the United States entering World War II. 
                The initial introduction of the character included the concepts of a soldier named Steve Rogers being given a serum bestowing enhanced strength and agility, wearing a patriotic red, white and blue uniform, carrying a shield, and having as a sidekick a teenaged Bucky Barnes. 
                In the 1960s, Marvel decided to test bringing the character back as part of the Avengers, with the premise that the character had been frozen for the two decades since the war, and was "haunted by past memories, and trying to adapt to 1960s society".
                Live-action performances of the character in television and film serials began within a few years after its creation, with a 1990 feature film resulting in critical and financial failure.
                In the mid-2000s, Kevin Feige realized that Marvel still owned the rights to the core members of the Avengers, which included Captain America. Feige, a self-professed "fanboy", envisioned creating a shared universe just as creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby had done with their
                comic books in the early 1960s. In 2005, Marvel received a $525 million investment from Merrill Lynch, allowing them to independently produce ten films, including Captain America. Paramount Pictures agreed to distribute the film.

                <br>a World War II combat series that portrayed the cigar-chomping Fury as leader of an elite U.S. Army unit.</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Creation: In 2002, Marvel Comics designed their "Ultimate" version of the character Nick Fury after the likeness of Samuel L. Jackson.
                In the mid-2000s, Kevin Feige realized that Marvel still owned the rights to the core characters, which included Fury. Feige, a self-professed "fanboy", envisioned creating a shared universe just as creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby had done with their comic books in the early 1960s.
                In 2004, David Maisel was hired as chief operating officer of Marvel Studios as he had a plan for the studio to self-finance movies.[9] Marvel entered into a non-recourse debt structure with Merrill Lynch, under which Marvel got $525 million to make a maximum of 10 movies based on the
                company's properties over eight years, collateralized by certain movie rights to a total of 10 characters, including Nick Fury.
                Jackson was then offered the role, initially signing a nine-film contract with Marvel to portray Nick Fury in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
                In 2019, Jackson confirmed that, while that year's Captain Marvel marked the end of his nine-film contract with Marvel, he would continue to portray Fury in future films.
                Aside from the original character having been white (a detail already changed in the comics before the MCU came to fruition), the original comic book Nick Fury was a World War II veteran
                who knew Captain America and led the Howling Commandos, and lost sight in his left eye during a grenade attack in that war. In both the original comic book and the Ultimate Marvel versions,
                Fury was able to remain active many decades after the war because he aged unnaturally slowly due to regular doses of an Infinity Formula.

                <h2>Actresses/Actors: Robert Downey Jr.</h2>
                <br>
                <h2>In comics: Iron Man first premiered as a comic book character, in Tales of Suspense #39 (cover dated March 1963).</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Creation: Iron Man (Real Identity: Anthony Edward Stark, more commonly known as Tony Stark) was created as a collaboration among editor and story-plotter Stan Lee,
                    scripter Larry Lieber, story-artist Don Heck, and cover-artist and character-designer Jack Kirby.
                    Lee wanted to create the "quintessential capitalist", a character that would go against the spirit of the times and Marvel's readership. Lee based this playboy's looks and personality on Howard Hughes,
                    as "one of the most colorful men of our time. He was an inventor, an adventurer, a multi-billionaire, a ladies' man and finally a nutcase."
                    The character's original costume was a bulky gray armored suit, replaced by a golden version in the second story (issue #40, April 1963),
                    and redesigned as sleeker, red-and-golden armor in issue #48 (Dec. 1963) by Steve Ditko. Lee and Kirby included Iron Man in The Avengers #1 (Sept. 1963) as a founding member of the superhero team.
                    In the mid-2000s, with a number of movies having been made from other Marvel properties licensed to other studios, Kevin Feige realized that Marvel still owned the rights to the core members of the Avengers,
                    which included Iron Man. Feige, a self-professed "fanboy", envisioned creating a shared universe just as creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby had done with their comic books in the early 1960s.
                    Jon Favreau, who was selected to direct the first Iron Man film, felt Downey's past made him an appropriate choice for the part,
                    and that the actor could make Stark a "likable asshole," but also depict an authentic emotional journey once he won over the audience.
                    Ultimately however, Downey ended up being the choice the studio made for the first character in their ever-expansive cinematic universe.
                    Favreau was also attracted to Downey from his performance in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005), with Downey frequently conversing with that film's director,
                    Shane Black, about the script and dialogue in Iron Man.</p>

            <br>
            <h2>In comics: Created by editor-plotter Stan Lee, scripter Larry Lieber, and penciller-plotter Jack Kirby, Thor debuted in the science fiction/fantasy anthology title Journey into Mystery #83 (cover-date August 1962).</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Creation: Kirby said, "I created Thor at Marvel because I was forever enamored of legends, which is why I knew about Balder, Heimdall, and Odin.
            I tried to update Thor and put him into a superhero costume, but he was still Thor." Lee and Kirby included Thor in The Avengers #1 (Sept. 1963) as a founding member of
            the superhero team.[11] A live-action television adaptation of the comic book character first appeared in the 1988 television film The Incredible Hulk Returns.
            Live-action film adaptations of the character were thereafter proposed, but did not come to fruition. In the mid-2000s, Kevin Feige realized that Marvel still owned the rights to the core members of the Avengers,
            which included Thor. Feige, a self-professed "fanboy", envisioned creating a shared universe just as creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby had done with their comic books in the early 1960s. 
            Mark Protosevich, a fan of the Thor comic book, agreed to write the script in April 2006, and the project moved to Paramount Pictures, after it acquired the rights from Sony.
            In May 2009, Chris Hemsworth was in negotiations to portray the title role after a back-and-forth process in which the 25-year-old actor was refused early on, then given a second chance to read for the part. 
            Hemsworth's brother, Liam also auditioned for the role, but was passed on by Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige.

                <br>
                <p>Creation: Lee cited influence from Frankenstein and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in the Hulk's creation, while Kirby recalled as inspiration the tale of a mother who rescues her child who is trapped beneath a car.
                    Lee gave the Hulk's alter ego the alliterative name "Bruce Banner" because he found he had less difficulty remembering alliterative names. The Hulk was initially grey, but coloring problems led to the creature being made green. 
                    Banner and his alter ego appeared in a 1978
                    Live-action TV series, and in a 2003 film that received mixed reviews, with Marvel Studios regaining the film production rights for the character in February 2006.

                    Louis Leterrier, who had expressed interest in directing Iron Man, was brought on board to direct, with a screenplay by Zak Penn intended to serve as a loose sequel to the 2003 film, but keeping the story closer to the comics and the 1978 television series.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Mark Ruffalo began his role as Banner / Hulk in The Avengers, after Feige said he chose not to bring back Norton.

                <h2>In comics: Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Don Heck, Hawkeye was introduced as a reluctant villain in Tales of Suspense #57 (Sept. 1964).</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Creation: After two more appearances as a villain in Tales of Suspense #60 and #64 (Dec. 1964 and April 1965), Hawkeye joined the ranks of the Avengers in The Avengers #16 (May 1965). His name being Clinton Francis Barton or Clint Barton.
                <br>
                <br>
                In the mid-2000s, Kevin Feige realized that Marvel still owned the rights to the core members of the Avengers, which included Barton. Feige, a self-professed "fanboy", envisioned creating a shared universe just as creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby had done with their comic books in the early 1960s.
                After initially offering the role of Barton to Jensen Ackles, who had auditioned for the part of Captain America, Marvel hired Jeremy Renner to portray the character on screen.

              Scott Lang is an ex-convict and electronics expert hired by Stark
              International, which enables him to steal the Ant-Man suit from Hank
              Pym, who had long since given up the name, to help his sick daughter.
              When Pym finds out, he gives the suit to Lang, allowing him to become
              the second Ant-Man. As Ant-Man, he serves as an Avenger for years, until
              he is killed during the Avengers Disassembled storyline. Years later, he
              is resurrected in the Avengers: The Children's Crusade mini-series.
              Following his resurrection, Lang heads the Future Foundation and founds
              his own company, the Ant-Man Security Solutions.

                      Spider-Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by
                      Marvel Comics. Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko,
                      he first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing Fantasy #15
                      (August 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. He has since been
                      featured in movies, television shows, video games, and plays. Spider-Man
                      is the alias of Peter Parker, an orphan raised by his Aunt May and Uncle
                      Ben in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary Parker died in a
                      plane crash. Lee and Ditko had the character deal with the struggles of
                      adolescence and financial issues and gave him many supporting
                      characters, such as Flash Thompson, J. Jonah Jameson and Harry Osborn,
                      romantic interests Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson and the Black Cat, and
                      foes such as Doctor Octopus, the Green Goblin and Venom. In his origin
                      story, he gets spider-related abilities from a bite from a radioactive
                      spider; these include clinging to surfaces, superhuman strength and
                      agility, and detecting danger with his "spider-sense." He also builds
                      wrist-mounted "web-shooter" devices that shoot artificial spider webs of
                      his own design.<br/> <br>When Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s,
                      teenagers in superhero comic books were usually relegated to the role of
                      sidekick to the protagonist. The Spider-Man series broke ground by
                      featuring Peter Parker, a high school student from Queens, New York, as
                      Spider-Man's secret identity, whose "self-obsessions with rejection,
                      inadequacy, and loneliness" were issues to which young readers could
                      relate. While Spider-Man had all the makings of a sidekick, unlike
                      previous teen heroes such as Bucky and Robin, Spider-Man had no
                      superhero mentor like Captain America and Batman; he thus had to learn
                      for himself that "with great power there must also come great
                      responsibility"—a line included in a text box in the final panel of the
                      first Spider-Man story but later retroactively attributed to his
                      guardian, his late Uncle Ben Parker.
